* About

  This is a simple scheme for Org mode to generate nice and readable HTML
  sites. Here are some examples of sites that uses this scheme (all in
  Norwegian):

  - [[http://folk.uio.no/larstvei/inf2810/v15/][INF2810 - Gruppel√¶rerenes side]]
  - [[http://folk.uio.no/larstvei/inf2810/v15/emacs-setup.html][Scheme i Emacs!]]
  - [[http://folk.uio.no/larstvei/inf2810/v15/veien-til-vakker-scheme.html][Veien Til Vakker Scheme]]

* Usage

  The scheme consists of a series of CSS and JavaScript files located in the
  ~css~ and ~js~ directory. To use it, simply include the lines starting
  with ~#+OPTIONS:~ and ~#+HTML_HEAD:~ in the top of this file in an ~.org~
  file. It assumes that the ~.org~ file is located in a directory like this
  repository, containing the ~css~ and ~js~ directories.

  If these conditions are met, one should be able to export the ~.org~ file
  to HTML using the ~org-html-export-to-html~ command, accessible by the key
  sequence ~C-c C-e h h~.
